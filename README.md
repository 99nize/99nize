<sup>"Oh, look! A human with a keyboard. How rare and fascinating!" ðŸŽ¹</sup>

I'm [nize](https://nize.foo), a web developer from the Philippines.

```yaml
OS: Fedora Linux, Windows 11
Technologies I like:
- React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Native, SolidJS, Astro, Qwik, Svelte
- Node.js, Express, Firebase, PostgreSQL, MySQL
```

TypeScript is my forte, but I'm currently looking to dabble with other technologies.
